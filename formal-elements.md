### 1. Players
- The game is designed to appeal to a wide audience, allowing everyone to enjoy it even without understanding all the technical concepts.
- Single-player with a leaderboard showing the fastest completion time for each level.

### 2. Objectives
- The packet (player) must reach its destination.
- The game progresses through levels with increasing difficulty, with the packet reaching its target in each level.

### 3. Processes
- **Starting Process**: The game begins with levels focused on the packet’s/player's movement without encountering enemies, simply learning to move, jump, overcome obstacles, and locate the destination.
- **Core Process**: The game gradually becomes more challenging, with each level introducing a new technique. For example, early levels require only running and jumping to reach the target. In advanced levels, enemies and more challenging obstacles are introduced, requiring more effort and strategy to find the target.
- **End Process**: The game is completed when the player finishes all levels. Players seeking more challenge can aim for the fastest possible completion time or break other players' records.

### 4. Rules
- Each level is limited, and players cannot exit it.
- The player has the ability to double jump but no more.
- There is no map or other navigation tool, creating a challenge in finding the target.
- The player starts with a single life, though some levels may have hidden extra lives.
- Players learn game rules gradually through trial and error and increasing difficulty.

### 5. Resources
- The only and most important resource in the game is lives. Each level starts with limited lives, and every mistake resets the player to the start.
- In larger, more difficult levels, there may be opportunities to find additional lives.

### 6. Encounters
- Obstacles like dead zones, firewalls, and network congestion.
- Malware as enemies.
- Searching for the destination.

### 7. Boundaries
- Each level has a unique closed environment.
- There is no visible boundary; however, if the player strays too far, the packet will get lost.

### 8. Outcomes
- The result of each level is the time it took the player to reach the destination, depending solely on the player’s skill.

There are games like Network Engineer Simulator, but they only relate to the network theme, not the gameplay style.
