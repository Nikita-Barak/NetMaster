### 1. Players
- The game is designed to appeal to a wide audience, allowing everyone to enjoy it even without understanding all the technical concepts.
- The game is a single-player experience with the addition of a leaderboard - ranking between different players based on number of objectives acheived and completion time.

### 2. Objectives
- Shrot-term: Deliver the data packet to its destination in each level while preserving integrity (lives).
- Mid-term: Return to previous levels to solve optional puzzles to repair broken network components for improved traversal or shortcuts, achieving new visuals and costumizations.

  #### Level Design
- Levels increase in complexity, representing different stages of a network:
  - **Home Network** (Simple and safe for beginners).
  - **Corporate Systems** (Mid-level with firewalls, multiple routing choices, and moderate enemies).
  - **Data Centers** (High-level mazes with dynamic obstacles and intelligent malware).
  - **The Internet Backbone** (Endgame with relentless challenges and multiple destinations to choose from).
- Each stage introduces new mechanics to keep gameplay fresh.
  
- Long-term: Minimize delivery time for leaderboard ranking.

### 3. Processes
- **Starting Process**: Early levels teach the player core concepts like movement, avoiding firewalls, and routing decisions in a risk-free environment.
- **Core Process**: The game gradually becomes more challenging, with each level introducing a new technique. For example, early levels require only running and avoiding obstacles to reach the target. In advanced levels, enemies and more challenging obstacles are introduced, requiring more effort and strategy to find the target.
- **End Process**: The game is completed when the player finishes all levels. Players seeking more challenge can aim for the fastest possible completion time or break other players' records.

### 4. Rules
- Each level is limited, and players cannot exit it.
- There is no map or other navigation tool, creating a challenge in finding the target.
- The player starts with a single life, though some levels may have hidden extra lives.
- Players learn game rules gradually through trial and error and increasing difficulty.

### 5. Resources
- **Power-Ups & Tools**:
  - Temporary boosts like **speed upgrades**, **shield bubbles**, or a **ping pulse** that reveals parts of the map.
  - Usable tools like a **packet splitter** (divides the packet to explore multiple paths) or a **decryption key** (bypasses firewalls).
- **Player Progression**:
  - Earn XP for completing levels, collecting data fragments, and achieving time-based goals.
  - Unlock perks (e.g., faster movement, extra lives, or increased ping radius) through progression.

### 6. Encounters
The game's main encounters are environmental hazzards and enemy units. For example:
  - **Firewalls**: Static or moving barriers that require timing or alternate routes to bypass.
  - **Congestion Zones**: Areas that slow down the packet or reroute it to harder paths.
  - **Malware Enemies**: AI that chases the player or sets traps (e.g., trojans that spawn new obstacles).
  - **Dead Zones**: Instant death areas that reset progress to the last checkpoint.

The encounters in the game are increasing in difficulty by:
- Increasing the number of either enemies or environmental obstacles when progressing the levels.
- Adding new types of enemies and obstacles when reaching new zones in the game.

### 7. Boundaries
- **Network Navigation**: Each level is a maze-like representation of a network, with players using logic to find the shortest or safest path to the target.

### 8. Outcomes
- The result of each level is the time it took the player to reach the destination, depending solely on the playerâ€™s skill.

### Market Research

We couldn't find a game quite like this.

There are games like Network Engineer Simulator, but they only relate to the network theme, not the gameplay style.
