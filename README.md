# NetMaster

## Overview
**NetMaster** is an single-player adventure puzzle game that follows the journey of a data packet as it navigates through a vast, complex network to reach its destination. Players step into the role of the packet, maneuvering through network elements like routers, firewalls, and switches, while overcoming obstacles such as traffic loads, malware, and dead zones.

The game is currently developed as a web-game (and aimed to later be a mobile game, making it accessible to a wide audience, even those unfamiliar with technical network concepts).
