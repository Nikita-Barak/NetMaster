# NetMaster

## Overview
**NetMaster** is an adventure puzzle game that follows the journey of a data packet as it navigates through a vast, complex network to reach its destination. Players step into the role of the packet, maneuvering through network elements like routers, firewalls, and switches, while overcoming obstacles such as traffic loads, malware, and dead zones.

The game is designed for mobile devices, making it accessible to a wide audience, even those unfamiliar with technical network concepts.

## Gameplay

### Objectives
- Guide the data packet (player) to its destination across multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
- The game aims to engage a broad audience, offering enjoyment regardless of the player’s technical knowledge.
  
### Player Experience
- **Single-player Mode**: NetMaster is designed as a single-player game with a leaderboard for tracking the fastest completion times across levels.

### Level Progression
1. **Early Levels**: Introduce the basics, focusing on movement, overcoming simple obstacles, and reaching the destination without woefull adversaries.
2. **Advanced Levels**: Increase in complexity with new challenges, enemies, and advanced techniques. As players progress, they’ll encounter hostile elements like malware and more complex network barriers.

### Mechanics
- Players will learn game mechanics progressively through experimentation and gradual difficulty increases.
- Key abilities include moving, jumping, and navigating without a map, requiring careful exploration to find the destination.

### Rules
- Each level is self-contained with no escape.
- Players have limited health (starting with a single life per level), with additional lives hidden in specific stages.
- Double-jumping is available, but no further jumps are allowed.

### Resources
- **Lives**: The primary resource, representing attempts within each level. Larger levels offer additional lives hidden throughout.

### Challenges
- Encounter a variety of obstacles, including:
  - Dead zones
  - Firewalls
  - Traffic congestion
  - Malware as enemies

### Boundaries
- Each level has a unique, closed world, but the packet can get "lost" if it strays too far from the objective.

### Level Completion
- The main goal of each level is to reach the destination, with completion time recorded to encourage skillful play.

## Target Audience
While similar games such as "Network Engineer Simulator" focus on the network theme, **NetMaster** stands out by blending network concepts with engaging gameplay, suitable for casual players and tech enthusiasts alike.
