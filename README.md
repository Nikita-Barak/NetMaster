# NetMaster

## Overview
**NetMaster** is an single-player adventure puzzle game that follows the journey of a data packet as it navigates through a vast, complex network to reach its destination. Players step into the role of the packet, maneuvering through network elements like routers, firewalls, and switches, while overcoming obstacles such as traffic loads, malware, and dead zones.

The game is currently developed as a web-game (and aimed to later be a mobile game, making it accessible to a wide audience, even those unfamiliar with technical network concepts).

## Gameplay

### Controls
The player controls a packet trying to move out of the boundaries of the level, using:
- WASD: For basic movement
- Shift: For movement speed enhancement (currently unlimited).

### Levels and Objectives
Guide the data packet (player) to its destination across multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
The game aims to engage a broad audience, offering enjoyment regardless of the playerâ€™s technical knowledge over networks.
Current levels consist of:

- A tutorial level - aimed to help the player have a decent understanding as to how the packet character moves and what's expected of it to progress beyond firewalls.
- A second level - more complex and features the first enemy unit we discover.
- A third level - an even harder level featuring many enemy units requiring different interactions with in order to progress.

### Encounters
The player will encounter many obstacles that will try to stop him on his way, for example:
- Firewalls, blocking the player from further progress.
- Enemy Viruses, chasing down the player if too close and corrupting the packet in one hit.
- Deadzones, making entire areas non-crossable (will be added in later updates).
